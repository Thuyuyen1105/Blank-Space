You are given a binary array 𝑎 of 𝑛 elements, a binary array is an array consisting only of 0s and 1s.

A blank space is a segment of consecutive elements consisting of only 0s.

Your task is to find the length of the longest blank space.

Input
The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤100) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 space-separated integers 𝑎𝑖 (0≤𝑎𝑖≤1) — the elements of the array.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.
